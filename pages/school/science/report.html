  <h1>Testing for Differences in Automatic Reflexes Between Sighted and Vision-impaired Individuals</h1>
  <p>Hypothesis: Some automatic reflexes can have different results based on the subjects ability relating to the part of the body tested.</p>
  <p>I will be testing the differences (or lack thereof) in reflex ability between sighted and vision-impaired individuals. I hope to see some differences in reaction, mainly in the eyes (So called “Blink reflex”, and the “Pupillary Accommodation Reflex”). I only have available a small sample base of 2 vision impaired subjects, and 5 sighted subjects. Please note that people can become visually impaired in many different ways, and this can affect results.</p>
  <p>My two visually impaired subjects are my father and mother. My father has optic nerve hypoplasia, and my mother has retrolental fibroplasia. My 5 sighted subjects will be my grandmother and her husband, my sister, and my friends Rohan and Michael. I will not be testing myself, as I already know what is going to be tested.</p>
  <p>I will test each subject in a separate room, as not to spoil the experiment’s aim for others. I will test with the “Blink reflex” until all subjects have been tested, and move on to the Pupillary Accommodation Reflex, with similar conditions.</p>
  <h2>Testing of the Automatic Blink Reflex:</h2>
  <p>I will be testing both the delay from stimulus until reaction, and what the reaction was. To test these, I used my smartphone’s slow motion camera, and counted the frames between the stimulus and the reaction. I then used a simple equation based on the framerate of the camera: (1000/240)*[Frames counted], to get an approximate millisecond value. The stimulus I used in this experiment was a loud clap directly behind the subject’s head. It would be interesting to see if different stimuli changes these results.</p>
