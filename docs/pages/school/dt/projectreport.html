		So far I’ve got a shelf installed in my closet(?), which was originally going to be used to store some of the stuff that was (and still is currently) on my floor. I did exactly that, by getting one of the computers that was on my floor, and putting it on the shelf, along with a monitor and a 15m extension power cable wrapped up to go about 5m (dangerous, I know). This computer is currently running Windows XP, but it can run Windows 10, so when I get home next I’m going to install 10 on it - I prepared an installer usb last night, amidst my main laptop (HP Spectre x360) having major RAM problems. I ended up having to switch to a Dell laptop I had in my drawers. I’m not entirely sure of the model, but it is one of the XPS series, perhaps XPS 13.<br>
		Anyway, I plugged in the laptop (in the closet) and set up the windows media creation tool, and set it going. When I got up this morning, it had finished preparing the drive, but the laptop had powered off and was making a *beep* *boop* sound, so I just turned it off and left it. I didn’t actually find out it finished until this morning (2018-03-06) when I turned on my laptop in STEM.<br><br>

		Installed Windows 10 on my x86 server computer (hereby referred to as x86server) in order to be able to access the extension router’s control panel (via ethernet). I ended up resetting the router anyway, because I somehow forgot the router's admin password. The router and x86server are all set up now, except for still having to use edge. Since x86server takes forever and a bit to turn on, the windows install took like 3 hours, because it had to restart like 5 times during the process - I decided to just sit back, listen to some music, and read Reddit while it was installing. Once I had Windows 10 installed, I opened the router's access panel and realised I had to reset it, by holding the reset switch for something like 10 seconds (the lights then started flashing). After the router had been reset, I selected all the options I thought I wanted, except that I chose extension mode instead of router mode, which I will have to fix tomorrow (today). Once the router had been reset, I was surprised to find that the Mac Mini that it was connected to by ethernet to the router's internet port was actually extending the Wi-Fi network it was connected to! I would have expected to have to do some buggery there.<br>
		I suppose it works for now, but I still need to do some troubleshooting, and I still need to connect the 2 routers together, and host the webpage on the Mac Mini.<br>

		Many days later, i finally have time to do some work.<br>
		Since it annoys me, there are 2 cables coming out of my closet where x86server and the router are, making it impossible to close the door. Let me fix that quickly - with a drill.<br>

		While i am doing this project, i have been making some random games and bits in class, so that i have something to do. I will instead try to make some different pages for my webpage. Started today on a “soundboard” page for my site, because why not? These pages are accessible at https://yogsoy.github.io/shimete. Pretty good, right?<br><br>

		Finally getting around to doing the writeup on the work i did on….. 2018-04-01, i believe.<br>
		Here are the various pictures i took of the undertaking:<br>

		Drilled a hole next to one already in the wall trim in my room that has a tv aerial cable through it for some reason… Drilled another hole in the ceiling of the room with the router. Plugged a 15M Cat6 ethernet cable into the internet port of the new router, and threaded it through the hole in my wall, through the roof cavity, and into the other hole. Plugged in the other end of the ethernet cable to the port where our printer was plugged in (no-one uses it - my parents are blind and i do everything online, my sister didn’t even know how to use a mouse until a few days ago), and that was it! Once I plugged the cable in and turned the router back on, everything worked straight away! IF IT WASN’T FOR WINDOWS 10 INSTALLED ON x86server NOT RECOGNISING THE ETHERNET HARDWARE ON THE MOTHERBOARD… I have decided to install the most recent version of Ubuntu server (17.10.1) on it instead, can’t be bothered to use windows anymore. I plan to host a mumble server on x86server, as I have experience doing that. I have ordered an 8M Cat5e cable to go from the new router to my desk (across the room), but that will not arrive for a few weeks. Another point that I forgot to add; I plugged an ethernet cable into the TV in my room, and now it has internet, so that’s good, I suppose.<br><br>

		Ubuntu 16.04.4 Server is installing on x86server as I type, however it seems it won’t be done by the time I will have to go to bed (which really should have been an hour ago), and I won’t have enough time later on before I leave for school to set it up, so this will probably be my last entry. On an somewhat unrelated note, I have moved my LED strip from behind my TV to in the ledge in the shelves of my desk, it looks cool as:<br>
